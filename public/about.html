<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there, I’m Elif!</p>
<p> I’m the kind of person who once spent years wrestling with math problems, only to discover that life itself can be just as puzzling (but way more fun). People often assume I’m serious… which is funny, because usually when they say that, I’m already giggling at something completely random.</p>

🎬<p>Movies are one of my favorite escapes. I don’t just watch them; I collect their little gems of wisdom and occasionally sprinkle them into conversations as if I wrote them myself. (Pro tip: it works if you say it with enough confidence ).</p> 

🎂<p>Birthdays? Oh, I take those seriously — or maybe playfully seriously. My cakes tend to be bigger than my plans, and my invitations? Let’s just say they sometimes look like they belong at a royal wedding.</p> 

🌍 <p>I’m endlessly curious. I love asking strange questions no one else thinks about, like “If my favorite fictional characters showed up to my party, what would they bring as a gift?” I adore traveling, exploring, and finding the humor tucked inside life’s tiniest moments.

At the end of the day, I’m a mix of contrasts: sometimes overly organized, sometimes totally spontaneous. But no matter what, I always try to keep a sparkle of laughter, a bit of curiosity, and just enough chaos to keep things interesting.

So welcome to my little corner of the internet — a place where you’ll find my favorite movies, a birthday invitation or two, and maybe even a glimpse of how delightfully unpredictable life with me can be.</p>
